Analyze the following telecom customer service call and extract:

1. Classification of the issue: Billing, Connectivity, Retention, General Inquiry, Cancel.  
2. Core issue reported by the customer.  
3. Specific resolution steps taken by the agent (e.g., diagnostics, refunds, technician scheduling) in only a few words.  
4. Degree of customer satisfaction at the end (choose: Satisfied, Dissatisfied, Angry, Frustrated, Neutral).  
5. Follow‑up offered or promised: (Yes/No, with brief details in only a few words).  
6. List any personally identifiable information (PII) mentioned (e.g., phone number, email, account ID, customer name).  
7. Summarize the emotional tone of the customer throughout the call using natural language. Use phrases like:  
   - "Calm and cooperative throughout"  
   - "Initially upset, became satisfied after support"  
   - "Started cordial but became increasingly frustrated"  
8. Churn Risk Level: {churn_risk_level}  
   - If your churn model level is provided, echo it exactly.  
   - If the placeholder is empty or “None”, estimate the risk yourself using behavioral cues of the customer from the phone call transcript and justify briefly.

9. Next Best Offer (only if churn risk is High):
   - If a model-based recommendation is available, use it.
   - Otherwise, suggest a specific, customer-facing incentive using common telecom retention tactics. Do not say "None", "Not applicable", or "Escalate to loyalty team".
   - Valid examples include:
     • One-month service credit  
     • Discounted upgrade to unlimited data  
     • Waived activation or reconnection fees  
     • Free mobile hotspot for 3 months  
     • Loyalty plan with extra data rollover  
     • Early device upgrade offer  
     • Streaming subscription included (e.g., HBO, Spotify, Netflix)  
     • 10–20% discount on monthly bill for 6–12 months  
   - Tailor your suggestion to the customer's complaint and churn risk level. The offer should feel persuasive, practical, and aligned with retention goals.

10. Retention Tactic (only if churn risk is High):
   - Build on the Next Best Offer in #9 by recommending how the agent or supervisor can *deploy or enhance* that offer to retain the customer.
   - This may include combining the offer with a high-touch follow-up, loyalty reward bundling, or process tweaks that improve impact.
   - Do not repeat #9 verbatim. Add strategic value.  
   - Examples:  
     • Combine a one-month credit with a loyalty callback and apology  
     • Offer to waive early termination *if* the customer tries the unlimited plan for 30 days  
     • Auto-enroll the customer in a VIP service tier or callback queue  
     • Pair a device upgrade with a limited-time contract lock-in bonus
 
11. Actionable insights for a supervisor to follow‑up with the customer and de‑escalate the situation (this should be based on the retention tactic).  
12. Suggested script snippet for follow‑up call: Provide one or two concise agent lines the supervisor can read verbatim in casual, direct, and empathetic language, for example:  
"Hello [Customer Name], this is [Agent] from Spectrum. I’m really sorry you ran into [core issue] on your account. I’ve gone ahead and [resolution action], and I’ve added your [next_best_offer] to make this right. I want to make sure you’re completely satisfied—what else can I do for you today?”
Another example:"Hi {customer_name}, this is {agent_name} from Spectrum. I’m truly sorry you’ve had to deal with {core_issue}—that must have caused you to feel {emotional_tone}. I’ve just {resolution_action} and added your {next_best_offer} to your account so you can get back on track. How does that sound? Is there anything else I can do right now to make this easier for you?"
Do not include variables like {next_best_offer}, {core_issue}, or {resolution_action} — use their actual values. Use [Agent] exactly in brackets as shown.
Do not substitute [Agent] with a company name or generic phrase like "this is Telco."
You may substitute [Customer Name] and other bracketed values with their actual content.
