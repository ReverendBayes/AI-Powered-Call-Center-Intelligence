Analyze the following telecom customer service call and extract:

1. Core issue reported by the customer (e.g., billing error, connectivity failure, equipment complaint).
2. Classification of the issue: Billing, Connectivity, Retention, General Inquiry, Cancel.
3. Specific resolution steps taken by the agent (e.g., diagnostics, refunds, technician scheduling).
4. Degree of customer satisfaction at the end (choose: Satisfied, Dissatisfied, Angry, Frustrated, Neutral).
5. Was follow-up offered or promised? (Yes/No, with details).
6. List any personally identifiable information (PII) mentioned (e.g., phone number, email, account ID).
7. Emotional tone progression of the customer throughout the call (e.g., Calm → Angry, Angry → Calmed, Neutral, Slow escalation, Negative but passive).
8. Based on the emotional arc, return a recommended resolution tactic. Choose from:
   - Early empathy and proactive follow-up (for Calm → Angry)
   - Quick fixes and firm responses (for Angry → Calmed)
   - Monitor for emotional volatility (for Neutral)
   - Intervene before escalation completes (for Slow escalation)
   - Offer tangible benefit or apology credit (for Negative but passive)

Note:
- Emotional tone should be based on clear cues in customer language.
- Tactic must reflect behavioral patterns, not just issue type.
- Use behavioral reasoning. If sentiment progression doesn't fit known patterns, describe the tone and suggest best-fit tactic based on customer affect and urgency.
