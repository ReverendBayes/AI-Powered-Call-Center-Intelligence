  "redacted_text": "Agent: Hello, thank you for calling TelcoPlus customer support. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer: Hi, I’ve been having issues with my internet dropping every evening around 8 PM. It’s been happening for the last week.\n\nAgent: I’m sorry to hear that. Let me check your connection status. Can I have the phone number associated with the account?\n\nCustomer: Sure, it’s [REDACTED_PHONE].\n\nAgent: Thank you. I see the account here—[REDACTED_PERSON], correct?\n\nCustomer: That’s right.\n\nAgent: I’m running diagnostics now. It looks like your modem signal has been unstable in the evenings. Have you made any changes to your setup recently?\n\nCustomer: No, everything’s been the same. I’ve rebooted the modem several times but it doesn’t help.\n\nAgent: I understand. Based on the logs, we may need to schedule a technician visit. Would tomorrow between 2 and 4 PM work for you?\n\nCustomer: That’s fine.\n\nAgent: I’ve scheduled that for you. You’ll get a confirmation text shortly. Is there anything else I can help with today?\n\nCustomer: No, that’s it.\n\nAgent: Thanks for calling, [REDACTED_PERSON]. We’ll get this sorted out. Have a good day.\n\nCustomer: Thanks, you too."
